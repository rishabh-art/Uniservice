      <h3>Welcome to Uniservice! üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüë¶‚Äçüë¶</h3>
      <p class="text">Uniservice is a non-profit organisation, created as an attempt to improve the social status of countries world-wide.</p>
      <p class="text">To us, the life of every person, of any kind and type matters. We are here to make a difference and to support these populations, because they may be unfortunate in any manner.</p>
      <p class="text">At Uniservice, we strive to make the lives of these people better, and to help you to contribute to worldwide issues, and we believe that service to others is the best things a 'human' can have.</p>

  <div id="userHelp" class="black-bulletin">
    <h3 class="heading-blackbulletin">How can you help us?</h3>
    <p class="text-blackbulletin">At Uniservice, we believe that the visitors to our website are the heart and soul of our mission to serve the world. Every time someone visits our website and takes action, whether it's making a donation or volunteering, they are helping us to make a real difference in the world.

      Without our visitors, we would not be able to achieve our goal of creating positive change and helping those in need. Your support helps us to provide critical resources such as food, water, and shelter to those who are less fortunate, as well as support important causes and initiatives around the world.
      
      Moreover, we believe that the act of donating or volunteering is not only important for the people we serve but also for the visitors themselves. By donating or volunteering, they can experience the happiness of serving these people, and giving back to the world we live in.
      
      At Uniservice, we are committed to ensuring that our visitors have the best possible experience when they visit our website. We strive to make it as easy as possible to donate, volunteer, and get involved with our community. We also appreciate every visitor's feedback and suggestions, as they help us to improve and grow our mission.
      
      We value each and every one of our visitors to the Uniservice website. Your support is critical to our success, and we thank you for helping us to serve the world.
